# GPG-online

This is a <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.github.io/gpgonline/">client side page</a> that allows you to easily PGP encrypt a message using to my pgp public key and, optionally, a private key.

Uses <a href="https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs">OpenPGP.js</a>.

My fork is designed to make it simple for people (even with limited computer knowledge), to type in a message and get an encrypted message to me back.
