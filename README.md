# GPG-online

This is a <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.github.io/gpgonline/">client side page</a> that allows you to easily PGP encrypt a message using one or more public keys and, optionally, a private key.

Uses <a href="https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs">OpenPGP.js</a>.

## Reasoning for the fork:

Read through the code myself to see if I think it's safe. I think so, but I would still recommend going over it yourself before using it if you are concerned. Actually, do that - read through the code, **then** you can go and use it. 

Forked to make sure I have a copy (stuck on my revision). I might do some UI cleanup later.
